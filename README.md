# ChormaticPolynomial
Software for the calculation of the Chromatic Polynomial of a graph
Download either the entire repository and run the main.py file or just download the .exe

 How to use:
   The buttons do exactly what they say
   the first textbox is used for the color variable of the Chromatic Polynomial, either leave the "x" to get the polynomial or enter a number to get the amount of Graph colorings with however many colors you entered
   the other two textboxes or just for output
   left-click and drag a vertex to move it, right-click to highlight it, the border of the vertex should now be red
   either right-click a second vertex to create an edge between the two vertices or click "Remove Vertex" to remove it, right click the vertex again to remove the highlighting
